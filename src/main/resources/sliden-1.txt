Tapir goals:

* programmer-friendly, human-comprehensible types, that you are not afraid to write down

* discoverable API through standard auto-complete

* separate "business logic" from endpoint definition & documentation

* based purely on case class-based, immutable and reusable data structures

* reasonably type safe
